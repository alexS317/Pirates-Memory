# ATJS Final Project

This was my final project for my 3rd semester university course "Advanced Topics of JavaScript". The task was to create a simple game (e.g. Memory, TicTacToe, ...) by using the technoligies we got to know throughout the course: Vue, Pinia, and Nuxt.

I decided to create a simple memory game, themed after one of my favourite movie franchises, "Pirates of the Caribbean", while making sure to fulfill all requirements.
